            <p>I was riding home one day<br/>
            when a number I did see,<br/>
            it was red and low and scary<br/>
            and it sure did frighten me.<br/></p>

            <p>But it was just a little ol' number<br/>
            nothing more than a crumb leftover<br/>
            if you knew what it could be<br/>
            you'd be buying just like me.<br/></p>

            <p>So I called my loving woman<br/>
            to tell her what id seen<br/>
            she said "it could be worse love<br/>
            you could be losing me<br/></p>

            <p>cause it is just a little ol number<br/>
            nothing more than a crumb leftover<br/>
            if you cared as much as me<br/>
            then you'd be problem free,<br/></p>

            <p>Cause you might just die from a nuclear attack<br/>
            cause an orange man with a trigger hand<br/>
            couldn't hold it back."<br/></p>

            <p>And you'd have lost all your precious possessions<br/>
            it'll all be gone<br/>
            you'd been all wrong<br/>
            when ya go to heaven.<br/></p>

            <p>I tried to hit the jackpot<br/>
            when I gambled on a bit<br/>
            at first it was the ether,<br/>
            then mine went to shit.<br/></p>

            <p>Now it's just a little ol' number<br/>
            nothing more than a crumb leftover<br/>
            if it went to nineteen three<br/>
            I'd sure be rich in BTC.<br/></p>

            <p>If I was you my friend, well<br/>
            I'd flee from all this pressure<br/>
            when the blockchain is a flopping<br/>
            you'll be free from the failing ledger,<br/></p>

            <p>But if you've got a big ol number<br/>
            and you can spare a crumb leftover<br/>
            iddoya a solid and take it over<br/>
            its all I need to get in the green<br/></p>

            <p>Cause you might die from a nuclear attack<br/>
            cause an orange man with a trigger hand<br/>
            couldn't hold it back<br/></p>

            <p>you'll have lost your precious possessions<br/>
            it'll all be gone<br/>
            you'd been all wrong<br/>
            when ya go to heaven<br/></p>
