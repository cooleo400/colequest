            <p>I was riding home one day
            when a number I did see,
            it was red and low and scary
            and it sure did frighten me.</p>

            <p>But it was just a little ol\' number
            nothing more than a crumb leftover
            if you knew what it could be
            you\'d be buying just like me.</p>

            <p>So I called my loving woman
            to tell her what id seen
            she said "it could be worse love
            you could be losing me</p>

            <p>cause it is just a little ol number
            nothing more than a crumb leftover
            if you cared as much as me
            then you\'d be problem free,</p>

            <p>Cause you might just die from a nuclear attack
            cause an orange man
            with a trigger hand
            couldn\'t hold it back."</p>

            <p>And you\'d have lost all your precious possessions
            it\'ll all be gone
            you\'d been all wrong
            when ya go to heaven.</p>

            <p>I tried to hit the jackpot
            when I gambled on a bit
            at first it was the ether,
            then mine went to shit.</p>

            <p>Now it\'s just a little ol\' number
            nothing more than a crumb leftover
            if it went to nineteen three
            I\'d sure be rich in BTC.</p>

            <p>If I was you my friend, well
            I'd flee from all this pressure
            when the blockchain is a flopping
            you\'ll be free from the failing ledger,</p>

            <p>But if you\'ve got a big ol number
            and you can spare a crumb leftover
            iddoya a solid and take it over
            its all I need to get in the green</p>

            <p>Cause you might die from a nuclear attack
            cause an orange man
            with a trigger hand
            couldn\'t hold it back</p>

            <p>you\'ll have lost your precious possessions
            it\'ll all be gone
            you\'d been all wrong
            when ya go to heaven</p>

            <p>Cause you might die from a nuclear attack
