          "Cole Quest and the City Pickers spread the good word of Bluegrass through clever original songs and a vast library of classics.  Their unbridled energy, tight harmonies and instrumental virtuosity will turn you into a believer in the good book of acoustic roots&nbsp;music."

        <p>"Youâ€™ve got to see this band live! Their catchy playing and endearing personal dynamic will make you sit up &amp; listen, tap your toes (maybe even get up and dance), and bring a big grin to your face. They make great old fashioned good time music in a modern and highly accessible way. And they just keep getting better and better!"</p><p><span className="color-bg-1">Maggi Landau</span> / <a href="https://www.caramoor.org/" target="_blank"><i>Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts</i></a></p>
        <p>"The ensemble is packed with individual talent and each musician exhibited virtuosic skill...What makes them special, however, is their sheer energy and exuberance. Here with Cole Quest and The City Pickers, the fun-index was in overdrive. These young players enjoyed themselves immensely for every second of their three hour show, and so did we. A band worth catching! Look out for Cole Quest and The City Pickers."</p><p><span className="color-bg-1">Frank Matheis</span> / <a href="http://www.thecountryblues.com/about-frank-matheis/" target="_blank"><i>Music Journalist &amp; Radio Producer</i></a></p>
        <p>"I fully attest that there is nothing quite like their live dynamic. The chemistry here is incredibly potent as musical ideas and gestures shared across the ensemble prove a unique familiarity...This motley cast of characters places heart behind every note. A worthwhile listen to a number of New York's "up-and-coming" folk&nbsp;personalities."</p><p><span className="color-bg-1">Nick Horner</span> / <a href="http://www.porchstomp.com/single-post/2016/09/06/First-Listen-Cole-Quest-and-The-City-Pickers" target="_blank"><i>Porch&nbsp;Stomp</i></a></p>
        <p>"Cole's music seems deeply rooted in his own perspective of the world and comes across as authentic. If you see one concert this summer make sure it's Cole Quest and The City&nbsp;Pickers"</p><p><span className="color-bg-1">Chris Pizzolo</span> / <a href="http://www.queensscene.com/news/2016-07-01/Nightlife/Tunes__Taverns.html" target="_blank"><i>Queens&nbsp;Scene&nbsp;Music</i></a></p>
